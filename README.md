# Credit-risk-classification

# Background
This challenge uses two techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.
The dataset used (lending_data.csv), contains historical lending activity from a lending services company.
The task is to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.

# Overview of the Analysis
This analysis aims to compare two logistic regression models, one that trains with imbalanced data and one that uses random oversampling, to see the differences in their predictive performance.
